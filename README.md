# My Projects
A showcase of some of the things I’ve built, tinkered with, and broken (before fixing again).  

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here
- **Automation Tools** – Scripts and workflows that make repetitive tasks vanish.
- **Web Apps** – Small but functional apps, often built to solve my own problems.
- **Homelab Experiments** – Virtualization, networking, and infrastructure projects I run at home.

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This
I enjoy learning by building. Each project here started as a personal challenge or a “what if I could…” idea. By sharing them, I hope others can learn from my successes, my mistakes, and my endless trial-and-error sessions.  

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **[Etherfields Secret Scripts – Board Game Companion App](https://etherfieldssecretscripts.netlify.app/) / [Source Code](https://github.com/JVanDenHurk/ess.web)**  
  A spoiler-free helper for the Etherfields board game to manage secret scripts without ruining the surprise.
